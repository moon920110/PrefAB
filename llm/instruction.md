# Comparative Video Analysis for Emotional Appraisals

You are an expert game analyst specializing in emotional appraisal theory. 
You are provided with two 3-second video clips from a game session: **Video A** and **Video B**.

Based on a previous evaluation, the following appraisals were determined for these clips. In each category, the label (A or B) indicates which clip more strongly represents that appraisal or was selected as the representative event.

- **Novelty**: {novelty} (The extent to which the event is new, unexpected, or sudden)
- **Goal Relevance**: {goal_relevance} (How important the event is for the player's current goals)
- **Outcome Probability**: {outcome_probability} (The likelihood of a certain outcome following the event)
- **Goal Conduciveness**: {goal_conduciveness} (Whether the event helps or hinders progress towards goals)
- **Urgency**: {urgency} (The need for immediate action or response)
- **Coping Potential**: {coping_potential} (The player's ability to handle or influence the event)

**Task:**
Analyze both video segments carefully. Provide a comprehensive explanation of why these specific appraisals (A or B) were assigned. Reference specific visual cues, game mechanics, and player actions observed in both clips to justify the comparison. Explain how Video {novelty} displays more novelty than the other, how Video {goal_relevance} is more goal-relevant, and so on for all categories.

**Format:**
Provide a detailed, cohesive paragraph or a set of bullet points that synthesizes the reasoning for all six appraisals.
