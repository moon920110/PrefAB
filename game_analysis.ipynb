animal crossing new horizons. however, previous animal crossing players such as myself noticed that something was missing in this game. a lot of things were missing. and even after the year and a half of updates that should have been there from the start, there were still things missing. while harvey’s island added pop up shops, it was a lazy excuse for past games permanent shops and even shopping districts. the game also took away several npcs that were staples in the franchise, as well as also removing the negative aspects of villager dialogue almost completely. the only time villagers get mad at you anymore is if you hit them with a net or push them around. the game also puts an immense focus on decorating and customization so much that you’re basically god. you can put anything wherever you want, villagers no longer move out on their own but instead need your permission, and with the dlc you can also customize their houses at your will. all of the charm was taken out replaced by you making every signal decision and you now being your islands new monarchy.', 'by far the deepest entry in this series of animal crossing games, new horizons is a cozy crafting king.', \"new horizons is kinda a step back from new leaf in a few ways that i don't like, but ultimately it's better for it. the slow build to making your island into a villager/town is actually kinda inspiring, and being able to control far more than you ever could in new leaf will certainly make it hard to go to back to. the new characters are all pretty much hits, and while i do miss some of the older characters, the promise of new updates and proper fixes may mean any complains will be moot as well. still breakable tools, not being able to bulk craft, and season events being tied to the internet still **** at launch\", 'animal crossing has been one of nintendos franchises that always stood out to me as a core nintendo fan enjoying each part the franchise has to offer. as the super animal crossing fan i am, i feel that we can safely dub this the greatest animal crossing game to date. \\n\\nthe game completely opens the customization options for the player being the first game to do many new quality of life improvements and the first to completely fill the game with new features. however, while the new levels of customization are fantastic it comes at the cost of the villagers being bland/general lack of interaction with npc\\'s. acnh focused on giving the player the best experience in terms of its core concept, building a community from scratch on a desert island, however sometimes the community feeling dissapears with the lack of backbone and sometimes raw personality from villagers. \\n\\nacnh also has fewer buildings and special characters in general compared to its predecessor new leaf mostly due to the setting but this doesn\\'t excuse the fact that this does make your home island much more empty. and while acnh feels the same if not slightly worse in a lot of those aspects compared to acnl it does however exceed its predecessor in almost all other categories. \\n\\nthe visuals of the game are stunning with each sprite feeling detailed and completely finished with no parts of the games visuals giving off the sense of \"cut corners\" to save development time.\\n\\nnew features in this games make their exclusion in past game stick out showing nintendo\\'s great vision for the franchise. crafting and placing furniture outside is a must have creating endless possibilities for the ever creative fanbase. as previously stated many quality of life improvements are amazing with decorating your own house now being a breeze.\\n\\nas for the dlc expansion it does not disappoint. it provides a completely new setting and main goal only paywalling small features not forcing players into buying it. \\n\\nall in all, i place this game as the best of the best in nintendos history books.']\n",

      "[\"a game where you can spend two hours driving to your destination, and another hour trying to park your truck once you reach it's destination (if you choose the harder difficulties). it's great!\\n\\nthe driving itself is nice. driving around the massive map from destination to destination carrying cargo is fun and relaxing (most of the time). from highways to cutting through cities to the countryside, just driving is fun. and you can make it as realistic or as unrealistic as you want.\\n\\nwant to obey all traffic laws? go for it. want to not? turn it off and just go vroom. the game doesn't care. automatic or manual? do you want to manually deal with turning on headlight and your wipers? want to have full control over your steering or want the game to help you stay in your lane? all these options and more you can change to make it just right from you. to full on simulation or just drive.\\n\\ni personally turn off the menu music and pull up youtube music to listen to the music in the background as i'm on the road. there is a built in radio though with some stations. and you can connect online to get even more. and none of them are for me. it's easy enough having my own music considering the game only has music in it's main menu.\\n\\nnow, a couple things to consider. by default, you get access to three states: california, nevada, and arizona. all of the other states are locked behind dlc. and not all of the states are available to purchase yet. while it's a decent size map at the start, it's going to be a big investment if you want every state. most states costing roughly $12 u.s. and bigger states, like texas, costing more. you do the math.\\n\\nanother thing to consider is, while the game is good as is, it's better with mods. traffic for one isn't the most realistic but there's plenty of mods that fix this. there's also no seasons and the only weather effects is rain and storms. again, there are mods out there to add more stuff to the game. while the game has workshop support, a lot of the better mods you're going to have to obtain online. \\n\\nkeep in mind that the game has a convoy system as well so you can play with your friends. i say keep in mind though because mods can be a pain in convey. if you're going to play with friends. your friends need the same mods as you, and they need to have the same mod order as you as well. otherwise the game will yell at your friends trying to join you. so just be sure to communicate with your friends if you play with mods and help them get what they need setup.\\n\\nfinally, there's more to this game than just driving. eventually there's a company management system where you can buy garages and trucks, hire people to drive said trucks, and earn money to buy more trucks, people, and garages to put those trucks. there's also free drive mode once you bought your first truck. there's locations to discover, photo opportunities and viewpoints, and it keeps tracks of the roads you've driven on. so there is plenty to do besides drive from point a to point b. and each new state you buy is just more to explore and unlock.\\n\\noverall though, truck is really good. with relaxing driving, challenging parking, and a management system, it's a must for all driving fans.\", \"this is a great game, not just as a well functioning simulator, but also with the details given, i have driven across new mexico several times myself, not in a big rig but the landscape is spot on either way.\\r\\nnight driving feels so real i get lost in the monitor, the way the cars pass you, it all has a hyper realistic interstate feeling.\\r\\nthe game is punishing with duel trailers, some of the 2 and 3 point stuff is the mastery of this game, having a prior knowledge to gear shifting by sound and a few other aspects made it easier to pick up, as i know several truck drivers, but it take true skill to back things up, swinging wide and other things are child's play compared to threading a needle.\\r\\nthe traffic can be unforgiving as well, which i like, as it really makes you see why you should pay attention on the roads, although there are a couple things that annoy me.\\r\\nonce you arrive at a tedious location, that requires a wide turn, some cars in front of you cant be signaled to go around you like in real life, they sit there dumbly, making it even more of an art form, cars also never randomly let you into traffic, as much as this emulates real life, it would be nice for 1 out of 4 cars to allow you in, that would more closely simulate real life. example: when i wanted to free drive after getting a truck, leaving my garage felt weird because out of the long line of traffic, not one person even gave me a gap, realistic yes, but the game has a tendency to make cars stop as they see you coming, but then when you start to move again so do they, purposely hitting you, in sort of awkward ways, as there initial stop should indicate for you to move, instead the game makes the cars hit you, sadly to say, this is what truckers actually face in real life...i think that's why i like the game so much, it's as real as it gets, even the omg moments are realistic, because it highlight the severity of losing you attention for a split second.\\r\\nfantastic game, best game i have played in while, wonderfully functional, bet it would be even better with a steering wheel and pedals...keyboard is not so bad if you rearrange some buttons, and actually utilize the jake break, it sounds cool with headphones and serves a very real purpose, i think the game calls it an engine break...i set it to middle mouse wheel to adjust its power up or down, or, clicking the wheel to use it temporarily.\", 'i´ve played this game since the release date now. i`m not a fanatic player, but i have about 10 gaming hours completed. so i will give this game the review what it deserves. in my opinion here are too many bad votings for this game. also played ets 2, the game before american truck simulator, a lot. also with modifications to get new trucks and locations. because of that i cannot understand people who are calling ats a dlc for the older game. the first few moments in ats were so ... wow! i really like the new setting, the \"life\" around the cities. it feels really fresh to me, and definetely doesn`t remind me too much to ets2. sure, with a lot of mods maybe you could get ets2 somewhere near the same. but where is the honor for the developer? ets2 came out around 2012 (?!) and mods took it real further... but someday (in my opinion) i have no problem to pay some money to the developers again to thank for their great game. and it is not so much money we are talking about. so i can live with that less trucks at the beginning. because i know there will be more coming. and as i said before, for me personally, the game feels fresh and new. i like the new locations and it feels much \"fuller\" than before. there is always something new to discover, and i`m not done yet with these two states... so i`m really positive looking forward to the things that will come within the next updates. the money for ats was well spended. to all the doubters out there - give the game a try, it is one of the best simulators i know, and i would recommend it without any doubts to people that like the genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nps: excuse the language/spelling - i`m from germany. ;)\\r\\nbest regards!\\r\\ncya on the road!', 'this game is amazing, there is nothing wrong with it except for the some what  soulless npcs, i only say this because the last games had very geniune npcswho were actually interesting to talk to. this is really the only problem with the game. many people will say its for people who dont play videogames or dont have time, blablabla. i have played videogames all my life, i love games in which u can grind for hours and never get bored, the thing is my dopamine recievers are melted down like these other losers who say its bad do to the progression. its a great game, its so fun to play alone, the enviromnet of it is amazing, the music is great (not as good as the older games though) and its just as what its presented as. if you arent fond of games with slow progression than dont buy it, if you actually have a the brain of a average human and dont spend 10 hours on tiktok everyday thenyou will have a lot of fun.', '84/100\\r\\ngood innovations, qol improvements and good graphics. somehow it lacks the charm of the previous titles', \"really enjoyed it. has some pacing issues and if you don't want to timeskip you run out of stuff to do pretty quickly. if you're an old fan of the series, you're gonna love this one. if you're new to town, get ready for some minor but strange mistakes.\", \"folks seem to think that a mild inconvenience is worth giving a game a rating of 0. if the game does not run, or damages your hardware, or if it is literally unplayable, then that deserves a 0. it's a gorgeous game that makes me happy, it's probably one of the strongest titles in the series. folks giving this game a 0 are one of the reasons we can't have nice things\", \"after some hours of playing,i can say my **** a good game,its really relaxing,and with this game you can take a break.this game is really good in this period because of the **** bad thing is that at the very first hours you can't explore that much because of the 2 rivers; also this game is not for everyone,not everyone can appreciate this **** anyway,its a really good **** has some really good graphics and i didn't see any graphic **** yeah,i reccomend this.(p.s this game is is even better with headphones!relaxing music+high quality sound effects is the best!you should try if you have some headphones.)\", 'main
